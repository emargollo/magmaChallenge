## Contributing code

The repository includes an Eclipse source formatter file ([`RobocupSourceFormatter.xml`](https://github.com/klausdorer/magmaChallenge/blob/dev/RobocupSourceFormatter.xml)), be sure to use it to format your code. Eclipse's "Organize Imports" feature should also be used. Both of these can be configured to run each time a source file is saved.
